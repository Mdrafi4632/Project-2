## Notes

Notes – Challenges Encountered:
- Flip Animation Issue – Initially, the card didn't flip properly due to missing perspective and backface visibility.
- Back Button Logic – Managing previous flashcards required tracking history correctly in the state.
- Spacing & Layout Issues – Buttons were too close to the flashcard, making the UI look cramped.
- Mobile Responsiveness – Initially, the app didn't scale well on smaller screens.
- React Rendering Issues – The flashcard sometimes didn’t update correctly when clicking "Next Card."
